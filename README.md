Greetings! I am co-founder of a web3 product studio called [Fungible Systems](https://fungible.systems). We build crypto products and other open source software. I was part of the early core team that built the Stacks network. 

I love toast, little moments, clouds, canoeing, and saunas. 

Hope you're holding up well.
